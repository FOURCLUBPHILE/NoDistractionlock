You manually edited the hosts file — the same thing the Python script does automatically.

You told your computer:

"Whenever someone asks for www.youtube.com, send them to 127.0.0.1 instead." 

Date and time refers to that we cannot open youtube or any other websites i have added in the working hours but not the case of remaining hours

=========================================================================================================================

✅ Step 1: Open Notepad as Administrator (Windows)
(If you're on Mac/Linux, I’ll guide you too — just keep reading)

Press Windows key, type Notepad
Right-click → "Run as administrator"
Click Yes when it asks for permission
🔐 Why? Because only admin can edit system files. 

✅ Step 2: Open the hosts file
In Notepad:

Go to File → Open
Navigate to:
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\
At the bottom, change "Text Documents" to "All Files"
Click on the file called hosts (no extension) → Open it
You’ll see something like:



1
2
127.0.0.1       localhost
::1             localhost
✅ Step 3: Add This Line
At the end of the file, add:



1
127.0.0.1 www.youtube.com
👉 Like this:



1
2
3
127.0.0.1       localhost
::1             localhost
127.0.0.1       www.youtube.com
Then save the file.

💡 If it won’t save, make sure you ran Notepad as Admin. 

✅ Step 4: Open Your Browser
Now go to:
👉 https://www.youtube.com

Hit Enter.

🎯 What Happens?
You’ll likely see one of these:

A timeout error: "This site can’t be reached"
A blank page
Or it takes forever and fails
👉 YouTube didn’t load.

Not because the internet is broken.
Not because YouTube is down.
But because your computer was tricked into going to 127.0.0.1 — which is your own machine — and nothing is there.

✅ So it fails.
